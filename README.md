# War-Card-Game

## Introduction
The War Card Game is a simple two-player game where the player competes against the CPU. Each turn, both the player and the CPU reveal a card. The player with the higher card earns a point. The game continues until one player reaches 15 points, at which point they are declared the winner.

## Features
* Simple player vs. CPU gameplay
* Randomized deck shuffling
* Score-based victory condition (first to 15 points wins)
* SwiftUI-based interface for easy interaction

## How to Play
1. Run the app on an iOS simulator.
2. The game will automatically deal cards to the player and CPU once the player presses the "Deal" button.
3. Both sides reveal a card each turn.
4. The player with the higher card earns 1 point.
5. The game ends once a player reaches 15 points, declaring them the winner.

## Acknoledgements
This project was heavily inspired by a tutorial from CodeWithChris on YouTube. Their guide helped me understand the core concepts of building the War Card Game using Swift and SwiftUI. I greatly appreciate their work and the valuable insights they provided.
